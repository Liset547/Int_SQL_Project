# Intermediate SQL - Sales Analysis

## Overview
Analysis of customer behavior, retention, and lifetime value for an e-commerce company to improve customer retention and maximize revenue.  

## Business Questions
1. **Customer segmentation:** Who are our most valuable customers?
2. **Cohort analysis:** How do different customer groups generate revenue?
3. **Retention analysis:** Which customers haven't purchased recently? 

## Analysis Approach

### 1. Customer Segmentation Analysis
- Categorized customers based on total lifetime value (LTV)
- Assigned customers to High, Mid, and Low-value segments
- Calculated key metrics: total revenue

Query: [1_customer_segmentation.sql](1_customer_segmentation.sql)

**Visualization:**
<img src="/images/1_customer_segmentation.png" alt="Customer Segmentation" style="width:50%; height: auto;">

**Key Findings.**
- High-Value segment (25% of customers) drives 66% of revenue ($135.4M)
- Mid-Value segment (50% of customers) generates 32% of revenue ($66.6M)
- Low_Value segemnt (25% of customers) accounts for 2% of revenue ($4.3M)

**Business Insights**
- High-Value (66% revenue): Offer premiun membership program to 12,372 VIP customers, as losing one customer significatly impacts revenue
- Mid-Value (32% revenue) Create upgrade paths through personalized promotions, with potential $66,6M --> $135.4M revenue opportunity
- Low-Value (2% revenue): Design re-engagement campaigns and price-sensitive promotions to increase purchase frequency


### 2. Cohort Analysis
- Tracked revenue and customer count per cohorts 
- Cohorts were grouped by year of first purchase
- Analyzed customer retention at a cohort level

Query: [2_cohort_analysis.sql](2_cohort_analysis.sql)

**Visualization:**
<img src="/images/2_cohort_analysis.png" alt="Cohort Analysis" style="width:50%; height: auto;">

**Key Findings.**
- Revenue per customer shows an alarming decreasing trend over time
- 2022-2024 are consistently performing worse than earlier cohorts
- NOTE: Although net revenue is increasing, this is likely due to a larger customer base, which is not reflective of customer value  

**Business Insights**
- Value extracted from customers is decreasing over time and needs further investigation
- In 2023 we saw a drop in number of customers acquired, which is concerning
- With both lowering LTV and decreasing customer acquisition, the company is facing a potential revenue decline     

### 3. Customer Retention
Query: [3_tetention_analysis.sql](3_retention_analysis.sql)

- Identified customers at risk of churning
- Analyzed last purchase patterns
- Calculated customer-specific metrics

**Visualization:**
<img src="/images/3_retention_analysis.png" alt="Retention Analysis" style="width:50%; height: auto;">

**Key Findings:**
- Cohort churn stabilizes at ~90% after  2-3 years, indicating a predictable long-term retention pattern.
- Retention rates are consistently low (8-10%) across all cohorts, suggesting retention issues are systematic rather than specific to certain years.
- Newer cohorts (2022-2023) show similar churn trajectories, signaling that without intervention, future cohorts will follow the same pattern.

**Business Insights:**
- Strengthen early engagement strategies to target the first 1-2 years with onboarding incentives, loyalty rewards, and personalized offers to improve long-term retention.
- Re-engage high-value churned customers by focusing on targeted win-back campaigns rather than broad retention efforts, as reactivating valuable users may yield higher ROI.
- Predict & preemp churn risk and use customer-specific warning indicators to proactively intervene with at-risk users before they lapse.


## Strategic Recommendations

1. **Customer Value Optimization** (Customer Segmentation)
- Launch VIP program for 12,372 high-value customers (66% revenue)
- Create personalized upgrade paths for mid-value segment ($66.6M - $135.4M opportunity) 
- Design price-sensitive promotions for low-value segment to increase purchase frequency

2. **Cohort Performance Strategy** (Customer Revenue by Cohort)
- Target 2022-2024 cohorts with personalized re-engagement offers
- Implement loyalty/subscription programs to stabilize revenue fluctuations
- Apply succesful strategies from high-spending 2016-2018 cohorts to newer customers

3. **Retention & Churn Prevention** (Customer Retention)
- Strengthen first 1-2 year engagement with onboarding incentives and loyalty rewards 
- Focus on targeted win-back campaigns for high-value churned customers
- Implement proactive intervention system for at-risk customers before they lapse
